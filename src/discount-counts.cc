/*
   This program discounts n-gram stats (of order >1).  It outputs the discounted
   stats and also the one-lower-order "discount" stats (by which we mean subtracted
   part of the stats, aggregated by removing the leftmost part of the history).

   The discounting method is a generalization of modified Kneser-Ney discounting (see
   Goodman, "A Bit of Progress in Language Modeling"), in which we discount a
   specified proportion of the (first, second and third, and 4+) counts, according to
   three values 1 > D1 > D2 > D3 > D4 > 0.  Note, D4 would be zero in standard
   modified Kneser-Ney, but in our method we allow it to be nonzero (in standard Kneser-Ney
  there would be no way to estimate it, but in our framework it's possible to do so based
   on dev-data probabilities.).

   Our method is a generalization of modified Kneser-Ney because in our
   framework, these counts are not automatically equal to one.  I.e. instead of
   dealing with counts-of-counts, we keep track of the discounted pieces and
   their exact magnitudes.  Note, be careful because our values D1, D2 and D3
   (and D4) are defined differently than in the original modified Kneser-Ney.
