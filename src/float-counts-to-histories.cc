/*
   This program reads in float-counts, and prints out just the histories of the
   LM-states it reads in (if the histories are not empty).  If there is a
   history-state "a b c" (written in the natural word order; it would actually
   be represented as "c b a" in the vector), then this program prints out a line
   " b a\tc" (note, they are all actually integers), with spacing such that
   string sort will coincide with integer-vector sort.  The use of the tab just
   before the count is a kind of hack to manipulate the order in which these
   things appear, so that states of different orders can be properly separated.

   The reason for this odd order relates to how we'll process them; we'll sort
   these lines and pipe them into get-null-counts.  That program will represent
   them as LM-states, e.g. in this example the lm-state for "a b" would have
   a predicted-word "c".

   Note: the reason for processing these 'null-counts' is to identify which
   n-grams are "protected" in the pruning operation.
